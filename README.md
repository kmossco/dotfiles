Personal configuration files for my Linux workstation.

## Packages
```txt
ruby      My <3 language
zsh       Shell of choice
git       Version Control
redshift  Display color temperature for GNOME
tmux      Terminal multiplexer
neovim    Text editor
sublime3  Main text editor
workrave  To avoid RSI
```

This is missing several config files due to sheer laziness. Coming soonâ„¢
